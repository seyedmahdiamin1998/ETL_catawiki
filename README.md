It's a project to **extract** data from a database,  **transform** them, and finally **load** it on another database. (ETL: Extract --> transform --> load)

In this project, I extract Jewelry data from the PostgreSQL database which we collected in the previous project from catawiki website.
After that, I transform this data and store useful features in another PostgreSQL database.
